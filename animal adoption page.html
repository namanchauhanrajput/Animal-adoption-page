            <p>The central issue in adoption is whether the new adopter can provide a safe, secure, and permanent
                home for the adopted pet. Shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations can refuse to supply pets to
                people whom they deem unable to provide a suitable home. A new owner may face training or behavioral
                challenges with a pet who has been neglected, abused, or left untrained. Adoption centers recommend
                patience, training, persistence, and consistency of care to help the pet overcome its past and get
                comfortable with the adopter.The adopter should have a plan in place for the care of the animal in
                the event of the adopter dying before the pet. A more restrictive view that some shelters attempt to
                integrate as part of the adoption agreement puts conditions on when and why the adopter could arrange
                to move the animal to a new family. Some agreements might specify allergies or violent behavior on
                the part of the animal as reasons allowable for an adopter to relinquish the animal. It is common
                for families to celebrate Gotcha Day on the anniversary of the animal's arrival at their forever home.

                   home for the adopted pet. Shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations can refuse to supply pets to

                   , training, persistence, and consistency of care to help the pet overcome its past and get comfortable
                   with the adopter.After filling out an application to adopt an animal, there is also an adoption fee that
                   must be paid to adopt an animal. Adoption fees serve several purposes. If someone is willing to pay for
                   an animal, chances are they will take care of him or her and not abuse or neglect their new pet. Most 
                   animals of age are spayed or neutered and up to date on all of their shots. Depending on the shelter or
                   organization, some pets may be microchipped, which helps locate them if they are lost. The adoption fees
              =     help cover these costs and also help provide food for the animals left in the shelter.
